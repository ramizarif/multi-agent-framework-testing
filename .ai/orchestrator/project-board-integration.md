# GitHub Project Board Integration

The Master Agent framework is now configured to work directly with the "multi-agent-framework-testing" GitHub project board.

## Integration Features

### 🎯 Target Project Board
- **Project Name**: "multi-agent-framework-testing"
- **Automatic Discovery**: Master Agent finds and connects to the project board on startup
- **Issue Management**: Direct integration with project board issues
- **Status Synchronization**: Real-time updates between agents and project board

### 📋 Available Commands

#### Project Board Commands
- `project-status` - Show current project board status and available issues
- `available-issues` - List issues ready for agent assignment
- `project-columns` - Show project board columns and their purposes
- `sync-project` - Synchronize local agent status with project board

#### Enhanced Core Commands
- `assign <issue-number>` - Spawn agent for issue from project board
- `status` - Shows both agent status and project board synchronization

### 🔄 Workflow Integration

#### Master Agent Startup
1. **Connect to Project Board**: Automatically finds "multi-agent-framework-testing" project
2. **Load Available Issues**: Retrieves issues ready for development
3. **Sync Current Status**: Updates project board with any existing agent activity
4. **Report Readiness**: Shows available issues and system status

#### Issue Assignment Flow
1. **Issue Discovery**: Master Agent shows available issues from project board
2. **Agent Spawning**: Spawn agents for specific issues using `assign <issue-number>`
3. **Status Updates**: Project board automatically updated as agents progress
4. **Completion Tracking**: Issues moved to "Done" when agents complete work

#### Project Board Status Flow
```
Project Board Columns:
- Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Testing → Done

Agent Integration:
- Ready: Issues available for assignment
- In Progress: Issues assigned to active agents
- Testing: Issues in agent testing phase
- Done: Issues completed by agents
```
