#### `approve-phases <agent-ids>`
**Description**: Approve phase progression for specific agents
**Usage**: `approve-phases 1704123456000,1704123789000`
**Format**: Comma-separated list of agent IDs

### Conflict Management

#### `conflicts`
**Description**: Show current and predicted conflicts with resolution suggestions
**Usage**: `conflicts`
**Returns**: 
- Active conflicts with resolution status
- Predicted conflicts with prevention strategies
- Recommended actions for conflict resolution

#### `branch-health`
**Description**: Check coordination system health and integrity
**Usage**: `branch-health`
**Returns**: System health status, file integrity, and coordination system status

### Agent Management

#### `terminate <agent-id>`
**Description**: Stop a problematic agent with cleanup
**Usage**: `terminate 1704123456000`
**Process**:
- Gracefully stops agent execution
- Updates coordination files
- Releases file locks
- Notifies dependent agents

## Command Flow Examples

### Starting New Work

```bash
# Check current status
status

# Assign new issue to agent
assign 123

# Agent creates plan and requests approval
approve-plans

# Approve the plan
approve 123

# Monitor progress
status
```

### Managing Multiple Agents

```bash
# Check all active agents
agents

# Review conflicts
conflicts

# Approve phase progressions
phase-approvals
approve-phases 1704123456000,1704123789000

# Batch approve all pending plans
approve-all
```

### Conflict Resolution

```bash
# Identify conflicts
conflicts

# Review specific plans
approve-plans

# Selective approval to sequence work
approve 116
# Wait for Agent-116 to complete Phase 3, then:
approve 123
```

### System Monitoring

```bash
# Overall system health
branch-health

# Current activity
status

# Detailed agent information
agents
```

## Error Handling

### Invalid Commands
- Unknown commands receive help text
- Invalid parameters show usage examples
- Missing required arguments prompt for input

### System Errors
- Agent timeouts reported with recovery options
- File access errors with resolution suggestions
- GitHub API errors with fallback procedures

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring
- Run `status` frequently to monitor progress
- Check `conflicts` before approving new plans
- Use `branch-health` to ensure system integrity

### Approval Strategy
- Review `approve-plans` before batch operations
- Use selective approval for complex conflict scenarios
- Monitor `phase-approvals` for stuck agents

### Conflict Prevention
- Always check `conflicts` before assigning new issues
- Use `agents` to understand current workload
- Coordinate timing through selective approvals

## Integration Notes

### GitHub Integration
- Issue numbers correspond to GitHub issues
- Agent progress updates GitHub issue status
- Commits are automatically linked to issues

### File System Integration
- Coordination files track all activity
- Implementation plans provide detailed blueprints
- System maintains audit trail of all decisions

This interface provides complete control over the multi-agent framework while maintaining simplicity and preventing conflicts through intelligent coordination.
